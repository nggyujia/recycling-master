# recycling-master
Homework 0 of Harvard's CS50 and my first game on scratch. More items to be added.
As an eco-conscious consumer and an environmentalist, I hope to create things that could show my identity and create positive influences at the same time. Hope you enjoy it and become a recyling master in real life.
